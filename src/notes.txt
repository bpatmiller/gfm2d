ij.x is NaN in snapped access???

FILE STRUCTURE
    data is stored in the plot/data/ directory
    one instance of a simulation produces the following datafiles:
        - phi.dat, which includes phi values and fluid types
        - velocity.dat, which includes an interpolated velocity at voxel centers
        - particles.dat, which includes marker particles used in the particle level set method
DATA STRUCTURE
    - phi.dat
    #x  y   id  phi

~~~ A Boundary Condition Capturing Method for Poisson's Equation on Irregular Domains
some facts:
    - the whole computation domain is solved in one step:
        "For eah grid point i, one can write a linear equation of the form...
        and assemble the system of linear equations into matrix form. Each
        Bk+1/2 is evaluated based on the side of the interfae that xk and xk+1 lie on. If xk
        and xk+1 lie on opposite sides of the interfae, then Bk+1/2 is defined along
        the lines of equation 48 and equation 33."

    - the coefficient matrix is unchanged
        "Furthermore,
        the oeÆient matrix of the assoiated linear system is the standard symmetri matrix for the variable oeÆient Poisson equation in the absene of
        interfaes allowing for straightforward appliation of standard \blak box"
        solvers."

QUESTION:
    does it require only 1 grid for velocity, pressure, etc?
    pretty sure (?)
